# fvwm95
---
This is a fork of fvwm95 meant to be compilable on and play nice with newer versions of Debian (and possibly Ubuntu and other distros, needs testing).

For screenshots, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/mintsuki/fvwm95/tree/master/examples)

It is based off the code from the source package in Debian Sarge, slightly modified so that it compiles without errors on modern Debian, and with a more sane configuration to adapt to modern day needs.

## How to build
The following packages are needed in order to build fvwm95 on Debian:
* xorg
* build-essential
* libx11-dev
* libxt-dev
* libxext-dev
* libxpm-dev
* libreadline-dev
* libxmu-headers
* bison
* flex
* autoconf

The following packages are not necessary to build fvwm95 itself, but
they are recommended to have:

* xscreensaver
* nitrogen
* thunar
* xterm
* lxappearance
* pulseaudio
* pavucontrol

## Switching locales

Sadly, fvwm95 does not seem to support UTF-8 locales at all, therefore, in order to run it, you'll have to switch to a ISO-8859-1 locale.

**This is something you might want to avoid, so think twice before deciding to install fvwm95 on a production machine.**

---
To switch to a ISO-8859-1 locale on Debian, edit the file `/etc/locale.gen` (as root).

In this file, comment out any UTF-8 lines corresponding to your locale, and uncomment the ones that specify `ISO-8859-1`.

For instance, assuming the locale you use is en_US:

Find
```en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 ```
and make it into
```# en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 ```.

Then, find
```# en_US ISO-8859-1 ```
and make it into
```en_US ISO-8859-1 ```.

Once that's done, save the file, then run:
```
sudo locale-gen
```

**You must now log out and back in to apply these settings, or simply reboot.**

## Actually installing
After all the dependencies are satisfied, configure, build, and
install fvwm95 by running:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```

In order to start fvwm95 with xinit, add the following to your
`~/.xinitrc` file:
```
exec fvwm95
```

To start it, simply type:
```
startx
```

Enjoy!
